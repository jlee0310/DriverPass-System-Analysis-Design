# DriverPass Project

## Introduction

The DriverPass project was assigned to us by a small consulting company, with the aim of designing and developing a system that provides online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare students for their driving tests. As part of the project, we conducted an interview with representatives from DriverPass, including the owner and IT officer, to determine their needs. The pre-made interview helped us to understand the requirements of various stakeholders, including IT, management, and customers. The goal of this project is to design a system that can handle the requirements of DriverPass and meet the needs of its stakeholders.

## Business Requirements

The business requirements document outlines the scope and objectives of the DriverPass project. It provides an overview of the features and functionality required for the system to meet the needs of the business and its customers. Key requirements include:

- Ability for customers to schedule driving lessons online or via phone
- Ability for customers to select a trainer and training package
- Management of training packages by the admin
- Tracking of driver schedules and progress
- Integration with DMV for updates and changes to regulations and policies
- Secure registration and payment processing for customers

## System Design

The system design document provides a detailed description of the technical requirements and architecture for the DriverPass system. It includes information on the hardware and software components required for the system, as well as the tools and infrastructure needed for development and deployment.

The system design also includes UML diagrams, such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams, to illustrate the various processes and interactions within the system.


## Module Eight Journal

The DriverPass project was a simulated project that required us to design and develop a system to provide online practice exams and on-the-road training for students to better prepare for their driving tests. DriverPass, the client, wanted a system that meets the needs of students by providing online practice exams and on-the-road training.

In our work on the DriverPass project, we paid particular attention to designing a system that could address the needs of various stakeholders, including IT, management, and customers. We interpreted the client's needs and incorporated them into our system design to meet the requirements of DriverPass while meeting the needs of its stakeholders. It's essential to consider the user's needs when designing a system to ensure that the final product is user-friendly and serves its intended purpose.

If I had to revise one part of our work on these documents, I would focus on improving the clarity of our system design diagrams. In the future, I plan to use various techniques and strategies, such as user stories and prototyping, to analyze and design systems to ensure that they meet the needs of all stakeholders. My approach to designing software is always focused on ensuring that the final product is efficient, user-friendly, and meets all client requirements.
